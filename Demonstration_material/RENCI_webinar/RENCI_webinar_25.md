#  Federated Learning with microservices webinar on [Stitching Together Innovation with FABRIC Users](TODO)

This session was designed for new and experienced researchers interested in leveraging FABRIC’s cutting-edge capabilities. The webinar features a 30-minute tutorial providing an accessible overview of how FABRIC can support ambitious experiments, including a showcase of Federated Learning with microservices on the FABRIC testbed by Alexandros Koufakis and Jake Jongejans. 
Alexandros, Jake, and their colleagues have leveraged FABRIC to forecast energy consumption and predict airplane maintenance needs using federated learning. They have utilized FABRIC to train models for global applications and to manage larger volumes of data. Moreover, they optimised the federated learning use-case on FABRIC by automating deployments across multiple intercontinental sites to research into the effects of network topology on federated learning training.
The session includes a demo of the experiment and a discussion on how FABRIC can empower other researchers, including its robust support and low barriers to entry.
